# React Native Notes

## Install React Native

In my case, I work on a MacBook and want to develop apps for iOS and Android; see [React Native Getting Started](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started) for details.

### iOS details

* Command line tools: version 11.3
* iOS Simulator: iOS 13.3

~~~bash

~~~

### Android steps

~~~bash
# Tap into AdoptOpenJDK
$ brew tap AdoptOpenJDK/openjdk

# Install
$ brew cask install adoptopenjdk/openjdk/adoptopenjdk8
~~~

Install Android Studio: [Download and install Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio/index.html); follow the instructions from the [React Native Getting Started](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started) considering a custom installation.
